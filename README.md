# Minimal LTI 1.3 implementation for Haskell

This is a *very* minimal and experimental implementation of LTI 1.3
authentication for Haskell.

# Warning

This project has not been tested yet. Using it right now is probably foolish.

## Development setup

Conventions: lines entered in a regular shell start with `$`. Lines that go in
a `nix-shell` shell start with `[nix-shell]$`.

This project provides Nix files for your convenience in creating a working
development environment. If you would like to install Nix, [there is a guide on
the official documentation](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ch-installing-binary).

```
$ nix-shell
# now you can run commands such as:
[nix-shell]$ cabal new-build all
[nix-shell]$ cabal repl
[nix-shell]$ hoogle server
```

## TODOs

* We are not compliant with [LTI 1.3 ยง
  5.1.1.5](http://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p0/#authentication-error-response),
  which requires redirecting failing authentications to the provider. Client code
  can probably make this happen, but we just throw an exception.
